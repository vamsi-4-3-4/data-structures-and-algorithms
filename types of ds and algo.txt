*TYPES OF DATA STRUCUTRES*

Data structures was classified  into many types based on the various cases 

We have the following data structures 
*1)primitive-data strucutres*
*2)Non primitive data structures*
*3)Linear Data Structures*
*4)Non-Linear Data Structures*

*1.PRIMITIVE DATA STRUCTURES*
primitive data structures  are the basic data types in our programming language 
 
By using this primitive data structures (basic data types) we construct some other data types 

*EXAMPLES*
1)Integers
2)Floating-point numbers
3)Boolean 
4)Character
5)pointer

*2. NON-PRIMITIVE DATA STRUCTURES*
Non primitive data structures are used to build other complex storages
Non- primitive data structures are further classified into two types
1. Linear data structures
2.  Nonlinear data structures



*3.LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES*
If the elements of the particular data structures are arranged in the sequence order then those type of data structures are called as linear data structures
*EXAMPLES*
1) *ARRAYS*
2) *LISTS*
*4. NON-LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES*
 If the elements of the particular Data Structure are stored without any sequence order then those type of data structures are called as non linear data structures

1) *GRAPHS*
2) *TREES*
3) *HASH BASED DATA STRUCURES*




*TYPES OF ALGORITHMS*
Unlike the data structures algorithm are field specific. 

In the  computer science we have the algorithms for the many fields. 

In this list I am not going to give the complete fields but I was decided to give the algorithms related to the major  roles in the computer science
