APPLICATIONS OF VARIOUS DATA STRUCUTRES

This will cover the following
1)why one should learn Data Structures and Algorithms?

1)WHY ONE SHOULD LEARN THE DATA STRUCTURES AND THE ALGORITHMS???
1)If you love to solve the real world problems you must understand the concepts of DATA STRUCUTRES AND ALGORITHMS
3)I personally observed that  Every software product is built,maintained,updated with the help of the Data Structures and Algithms 
here are the few examples:
1)ARRAY DATA STRUCUTRE
1)contacts that was stored in our SmartPhone or MobilePhone
2)Leader-Board management on the Games
3)Image Processing Applications
4)Speech Processing Applications
5)for the building of the other data structures like:
ArrayList 
Heaps
HashTables
Vectors
Matrices
6)To implement the Sorting Algorithms like:
Insertion Sort
Quick Sort
BUbble Sort
Merge Sort
7)To store the data in the form of Tables
8)Online Ticket Booking 

2)LINKED LISTS

1) For Implementing of STACKS,QUEUES,BINARY TREES and GRAPHS
2)Dynamic Memory Management of Operating Systems
3)Polynomial Implementation
4)Round Robin in Operating Systems

5)CIRCULAR LINKED LIST 
for showing slides in the presentation applications 
for showing images in the Album and Photos applications
6)ALT+TAB feature in the Windows Operating System
7)Browse through opened applications  to select a required application  to work again
8)We use the doubly LinkedList for the Forward and Backward button implementations
9)CIRCULAR QUEUE
Maintains playing sequence of multiple players in a multiplayer games
10)web pages to show the  URL`s(Uniform Resource Locators)
11)Symbol table management of a complier
12)To avoid the collision between data in a hashmap
13)UNDO,REDO operations in a Operating System
14)To get the new tracks in the Music Players
15)To represent deck of cards in a  cards game
16)To represent the stages of the game
17)To implement snake games
3)STACKS
1)Used as a Temporary storage structure for the recursive operations
2)used as a Auxiliary storage structure for nested operations and the function calls,defered or postponed functions
3)used to manage function calls
4)For the evaluation of functions in any programming languages
5)infix expressions into postfix expression conversions
6)For checking  of the syntax in programming language
7)matching of parenthesis in a problem
8)To reverse the Strings
9)To find the solutions of the problems with the help of backtracking
10)Depth First Search on the Graph and the Tree traversal implementation
11)UNDO ,REDO features of an operatingsystem
12)History of the visited websites in the web browser
13)Forward and the Backward in  web browser
14)CALL logs in the mobile phone and Smart Phone
To show the emails of an EmailService
To show the photos on Google photos
To show the  Downloads of an Youtube
To show the Notifications of an Mobile Phone or Smart Phone
15)Scratch Cards schemes
4)QUEUES
1)Breadth First Search traversal implementation
2)Job scheduler of an OperatingSystem
To implement Buffer Queue
To implement Keyboard Buffer Queue
3)For the scheduling of CPU
4)For the scheduling of Disk
5)priority queue used in file download operations
6)data transfer between cpu and the peripherals
7)interrupts generated by user applications for cpu
8)calls handled by the BPO
9)handling congestion in Networking
10)Server while handling request
11)uploading and downloading of files
12)Internet Requests Processinng
13)Switching multiple operations
5)TREES
1)File systems and Directories
2)Navigation structure of a website
3)code generator for Hauffmans code
4)gaming application decision making
5)priority based OS scheduling
6)parsing of expressions and statements in programming language
7)for sorting data keys for DBMS for indexing
8)Spanning trees for routing decisions in computer and communication networks
9)Hash trees
10)path finding algorithms used in AI,Robotics,Video Games
11)XML parser
12)Decision Based algorithms in ML
13)indexing in an DataBases
14)DNS
15)BST in computer Graphics
6)GRAPHS
1)Representing networks and routes in communications and transportation
2)routes in GPS
3)interconnections in social Media
4)Ecpmmerce to represent user preferences
5)document link map of a website to display connection between pages through hyperlinks
6)robotic motion and neural networks
7)data organization
7)HASHTABLES
1)Data stored in a databases
2)search filtering
3)message digest in the Cryptography
4)filename and filepath connections
8)HEAP
1)Matrix
2)sesmic surveys in geology
3)plotting of graphs
4)real world data representation
